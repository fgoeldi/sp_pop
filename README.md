# Sao Paulo Population
This is a quick experimentation with leaflet.js, a lightweight and easy to use map library. The idea was to bring this leaflet tutorial to a more familiar location, the São Paulo metropolitan area. The data comes from the Centro de Estudos da Metropole and depicts the absolute population in 2000.
